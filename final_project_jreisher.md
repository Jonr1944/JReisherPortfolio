## *Project Outline*

##### _Summary:_ 
This project will evaluate COVID19 disinformation as it relates to vaccine efficacy amongst the Spudnik V, SinoPharm, AstraZeneca, and Moderna/Pfizer/Johnson&Johnson vaccine distribution in Hungary. The intent is to demonsrate how media and social media can influence important health, political, or social issues. 

##### _Outline:_

__Intended  Audience:__ 
Primary - Anyone concerned about COVID19, disinformation, or the rise of authoritarianism. 
Secondary - Policy makers

__Frame 1:__ Introduction - Introduce the topic with a few disinformation examples (political cartoons maybe?) 

__Frame 2:__ The Problem- The next frame will highlight how Victor Orban has or could used the pandemic to consolidate authoritarian rule. I also need to explain "Why Hungary?" The answer is, while Hungary is an EU member it is one of the few EU contries allowing the SinoPharm, Spudnik v, AstraZenca, and Moderna/Pfizer/Johnson&Johnson vaccines. Additionally, Russia and China have significant econmic and political interests which makes Hungary a ideological 'battleground' between major powers. 

- Silence Opposition: Orban's administration created fake news that opposition parties did not want people to get vaccinated so people would die and it would make Orban look bad ahead of next year's election.
- Limit Free Press: Create more standards concerning what can and cannot be published by state ran media (Soft Censursihip)
- Limit freedom of assembly: In the wake of the 2022 election, Orban can use 'public health' mandates to limit opposition rallies or organizing activities

__Frame 3:__ Example COVID 19 Disinformation or Information- An interactive infographic would be useful to allow users the opportunity to explore types of missinformation or media related to COVID19. This would give the viewer a better understanding of the media environment.

__Frame 4:__ Graph #1- A simple line chart of COVID19 cases and deaths

__Frame 5:__ Graph #2: A simple line chart of the four main vaccines available to Hungarians. This will demonstrate the viewer changes in innoculation over time. 
         
         Graph #3: A bar chart of total vaccines adminstered by type to illustrate the viewer which vaccines have been more popular. 
         
*Note:* I will need to explain the process of Hungarian vaccination since people can activly choose which vaccine to receive. 

__Frame 6:__ Graph #4: Illustration of vaccination rates by type and age. The intent with graph #4 is to show any trends in vaccination rates by age. Perhaps certain age categories prefer certain types of vaccines over others. The only limitaion is that the Hungarian Government rquires people under 65 with underlaying health conditions to receive the AstraZenca vaccine. 

__Frame 7:__ The 'So What?' of Vaccine Disinformation- 

__Frame 8:__ Call to Action- My call to action will be "Think before you share." The intent is to make people think before they share things on social media, which is particularly virulant vector for disinformation. I will also include links to resrources to help identify disinformation.

__Project Goal:__ I hope this project inceases awarness around disinformation and how a public health emergency, or any other black swan event, might be used by authoritarian governments to crush political opposition. I would also like viewers to become more aware consumers of information. The things they share might lead to someone they know not getting vaccinated which increases everone's risk.

## *The Data* 

The primary source of Hungarian COVID19 related data is the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The ECDC is a European Union agencey "aimed at strengthening Europe's defences against infectious diseases." The data is realitivly easy to work with. The only data cleaning it required was to extract the Hungary specific information and clean up the date formats. 

I took two data sets from the ECDC website. The first data set is EU COVID19 data that shows the number of COVID19 cases and related deaths. I plan on using this data to show 'how bad' COVID19 was and is in Hugary. The second data set I pulled is the number of COVID vaccinations in Hungary by vaccination type, age, and date. I hope to use this data to illustrate which vaccines are more popular. Because each vaccine is from a different country (Russia, China, Great Britian, and the US respectivly) this might give a good indication of what information or disinformation is resonating with Hungarians. The difficult part here is relating vaccination to specific information campaigns.

## *Method and Medium* 

In terms of constructing my project I plan to use ShortHand. The main reason I plan to use ShortHand is tha I have built several presentations with Esri's Story Map and would like to learn a new platform. Currently, I plan to use Tableau to build the majority of the data visualisations (all four graphs). If needed I might use R to help with complex statistical analysis because I am comfortable with R. I think that I will need to make at least two infographics. One infographic for  Frame 2, describing the problem, and another one for Frame 7, the presentation "So What?" section. For constructing my infographics, I plan on using a website called [Canva](https://www.canva.com) which specializes  in infographic development.

For now, I plan on using my final ShortHand product for the final, 60 second presentaion. The reason is that I think it will be a good test if my ShortHand site is easially consumable. Disinformation and vaccine efficay are very complex topics. So it is vital that my data visualizations and content are consumable. If a person can scroll through the site in 60 seconds and understand the site then they are more lilkley to go back and engage further after I have their interest.
