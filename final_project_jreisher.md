## *Project Outline*

##### _Summary:_ 
This project will evaluate the Hungarian COVID19 disinformation as it relates to vaccine efficacy amongst the Spudnik V, SinoPharm, AstraZeneca, and Moderna/Pfizer vaccines. 
The intent is to demonsrate how media and social media can influence important health, political, or social issues. 

##### _Outline:_

Frame 1: Introduction - Introduce the topic with a few disinformation examples (political cartoons maybe?) 

Frame 2: The Problem- The next frame will highlight how Victor Orban has or could used the pandemic to consolidate authoritarian rule

- Silence Opposition: Orban's administration created fake news that opposition parties did not want people to get vaccinated so people would die and it would make Orban look bad ahead of next year's election.
- Limit Free Press: Create more standards concerning what can and cannot be published by state ran media (Soft Censursihip)
- Limit freedom of assembly: In the wake of the 2022 election, Orban can use 'public health' mandates to limit opposition rallies or organizing activities

Frame 3: Example COVID 19 Disinformation or Information- An interactive infographic would be useful to allow users the opportunity to explore types of missinformation or media related to COVID19. This would give the viewer a better understanding of the media environment.

Frame 4: Graph #1- A simple line chart of COVID19 cases and deaths

Frame 5: Graph #2: A simple line chart of the four main vaccines available to Hungarians. This will demonstrate the viewer changes in innoculation over time. 
         
         Graph #3: A bar chart of total vaccines adminstered by type to illustrate the viewer which vaccines have been more popular. 
         
*Note:* I will need to explain the process of Hungarian vaccination since people can activly choose which vaccine to receive.

## *The Data* 

The primary source of Hungarian COVID19 related data is the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The ECDC is a European Union agencey "aimed at strengthening Europe's defences against infectious diseases." The data is realitivly easy to work with. The only data cleaning it required was to extract the Hungary specific information and clean up the date formats. 

I took two data sets from the ECDC website. The first data set is EU COVID19 data that shows the number of COVID19 cases and related deaths. I plan on using this data to show 'how bad' COVID19 was and is in Hugary. The second data set I pulled is the number of COVID vaccinations in Hungary by vaccination type, age, and date. I hope to use this data to illustrate which vaccines are more popular. Because each vaccine is from a different country (Russia, China, Great Britian, and the US respectivly) this might give a good indication of what information or disinformation is resonating with Hungarians. The difficult part here is relating vaccination to specific information campaigns.
