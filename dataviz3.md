### Product Testing

##### Person #1 (No Design Education)

**1. Out of the below three visualization ideas, which one do you find most appealing? Which one are you immediately drawn to?**
I am immediately drawn to graph #3.  

**2. For the visualization that you find most appealing please answer the following:**

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

This graph depicts the percentage of federal debt compared to the GDP.

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

The graph shows that the percentage of federal debt fluctuates, though it has been sharply increasing.

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

No.

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

The intended audience is people who are interested in the economy.

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

I would add a dashed line at 100% to more clearly visualize the total percentage.
