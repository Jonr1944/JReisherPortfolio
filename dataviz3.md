# Critique and Re-Design of Forbes US Debt Levels Line Chart

## Origional Visualisation: Forbes Line Graph
This original line chart appeared in Forbes Magazine Online on December 29th, 2020. Entitled "Federal Debt A Danger To Business, But Not This Year," the purpose of the article is to explain the role of the US debt on the economy and business. The last time the debt was over 100% was in WWII.

## Government Data : White House Budget 

The raw data I found on the White House Budget wepage under OMB and historical data tables (Table Table 7.1). I had to clean the data to be able to work with only the information of interest. Which in this case was the US Debt as a percent of GDP for 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020. 

The data I found was very similar to what Forbes present with the notable exception that the raw data I found through OMB had the percent debt to GDP ratio for 2020 as 128% while Forbes, also citing OMB, shows 100.2%. I assume that this descrepancy might be due to OMB still conducting audits or other bugetary functions. At the time of writing it was still 2020 so perhaps more analysis has since been conducted.

## CritiqueMethod: Data Visualisation Effectiveness Profile

For my critique, I used Stephen Few's Data Visualisation Effectiveness Profile. Which breaks down data visualizations into two general categories informative (produces understanding) and emotive (produces a useful emotional response).

*Seven Criteria:*

  -Informative
    
    -Usefulness
    
    -Completeness
    
    -Perceptibility
   
   -Truthfulness
   
   -Intuitivness
  
  -Emotive
    
    -Aesthetics
    
    -Engagment

My biggest critique is that the emotive criteria of the original graph take away from almost all of the informative utility of the graph. In particular, the color scheme and line work are so bad I did not even want to engage with the chart at all. 

-Excerpt from my critique: My first thought is that this is an extremely ugly graph. It is not at all appealing to look at to the extent that I am not even looking at the information. The use of color leads a lot to be desired and makes me want to stop looking at the graph; specifically, the teal and bright red line clash in a headache-inducing way. Additionally, all the numbers, titles, and axis are in bold. The line work takes away any layering that could help the viewer focus on the essential parts of the graph, like the title. It is also not clear that the line on the graph is federal debt as a percent of GDP. The viewer must-read part of the article to be certain that is what the graph is depicting-

## Wire Diagrams / Prototypes

##### Idea #1: Pie Charts over time

##### Idea #2: Remade Line Graph

##### Idea #3: Bar Chart with 2020 Highlighted

## Product Testing

To compliment my critique of the Forbes line chart and aid in producing my reworked graph, I sent all three wire diagrams to two people for comment. One person is in the data visualization class with me and the other is not. I sent the wire diagrams and questions to both to simulate them viewing the diagrams as stand-alone products. I did not want to sway their comments by standing next to them, explaining unclear elements or design. I think it was interesting to have someone that is not in a design course complete the critique. Specifically, person #2 brought up many basic design principles in their review even without formal training. Even if it's not a 'deliberate' design comment, people intrinsically have great ideas about what 'right looks like' in terms of good data visualization. 

#### Person #1 (No Design Education)

**1. Out of the below three visualization ideas, which one do you find most appealing? Which one are you immediately drawn to?**

_I am immediately drawn to graph #3._  

**2. For the visualization that you find most appealing please answer the following:**

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

_This graph depicts the percentage of federal debt compared to the GDP._

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

_The graph shows that the percentage of federal debt fluctuates, though it has been sharply increasing._

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
_No._

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

_The intended audience is people who are interested in the economy._

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

_I would add a dashed line at 100% to more clearly visualize the total percentage._

#### Person #2 (In Design Class)

*1. Out of the below three visualization ideas, which one do you find most appealing? Which one are you immediately drawn to?*

_I was immediately drawn to #1 because it's the most aesthetically interesting one. But when I realised what the chart was about, I also realised that #1 was the hardest to conduct comparisons between the different decades. That's when I started paying more attention to #2 and #3. Between the two, #2 was more appealing._ 

*2. For the visualization that you find most appealing please answer the following:*

- Can you tell me what you think this is? 

_This is a line depicting federal debt as a percentage of US GDP._

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

_This line is telling me that federal debt as a percentage of US GDP has reached a level in 2020 that is unprecedented._ 

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

_At first, I was confused as to why something could be over 100%, because we usually think about statistics or similar graphs being only up to 100%. It took me awhile to figure out that this was as a percentage of US GDP, so debt could go above current GDP. I was confused by the phrase" excluding intra-gov holdings" as I do not know what that means and there is no explanation for it._ 

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

_People who are interested in small government, or the average reader who likes to be informed._

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

_I thought the line was interesting because the last time debt was so high was during / after WWII. I took me awhile to make that connection, so maybe the graph could highlight that through a subtitle or marking (if that is indeed the point being made). Otherwise, I like the simplicity of the graph._ 


## Design

I decided to work with idea #3, the bar graph. A bar graph better illustrates change over time than the pie chart because it is one continuous graphic instead of eight separate charts. The continuity makes it a much easier product to translate for the viewer. Additionally, the comment about putting a dashed line at the 100% US Debt to GDP mark highlights the proportion of debt to GDP in much the same way that the pie charts do. 

I think the reworked line chart (idea #2) would also be a clean way to depict change over time. However, since the original author categorizes the data by decade, the bar graph is a much cleaner way to express the change. It follows the rule of simplicity in that it takes a yearly rate and shows every ten years. 

When designing the final product, I wanted to draw the viewer's attention to the 2020 data. I first chose a color palette using coolers. Consequently, I decided to make the 2020 bar a dark red and use a blue-grey for the rest of the data. I also wanted to highlight the 100% debt to GDP ratio, so I chose a dark blue to visually highlight the portion of the debt to GDP as it changed over time. I went with a basic graph design and no background because the light teal background in the original significantly distracted from the data.


[Palette Creation](https://coolors.co/0b3954-087e8b-bfd7ea-ff5a5f-c81d25)

I also cleaned up the title and y-axis labels by ensuring that they were more apparent to the viewer and adequately centered on the data. I excluded the part of the subtitle about intra-government holdings because it confused person #2 in the review and was not essential to the article.
