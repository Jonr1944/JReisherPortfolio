## Product Testing

To compliment my critique of the Forbes line chart and aid in producing my reworked graph, I sent all three wire diagrams to two people for comment. One person is in the data visualization class with me and the other is not. I sent the wire diagrams and questions to both of them to simiulate them viewing the diagrams as stand alone products. I did not want to sway their comments by standing next to them explaining unclear elments or design. I think it was interesting to have someone that is not in a design course compleate the critique. Specifically because even without formal training, many basic design principles were brought up. Even if it's not a 'deliberate' deisgn comment, people intrinsically have great ideas about what 'right looks like' in terms of good data visualization. 

#### Person #1 (No Design Education)

**1. Out of the below three visualization ideas, which one do you find most appealing? Which one are you immediately drawn to?**
_I am immediately drawn to graph #3._  

**2. For the visualization that you find most appealing please answer the following:**

- Can you tell me what you think this is?
_This graph depicts the percentage of federal debt compared to the GDP._

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
_The graph shows that the percentage of federal debt fluctuates, though it has been sharply increasing._

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
_No._

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
_The intended audience is people who are interested in the economy._

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
_I would add a dashed line at 100% to more clearly visualize the total percentage._

#### Person #2 (In Design Class)

*1. Out of the below three visualization ideas, which one do you find most appealing? Which one are you immediately drawn to?*
_I was immediately drawn to #1 because it's the most aesthetically interesting one. But when I realised what the chart was about, I also realised that #1 was the hardest to conduct comparisons between the different decades. That's when I started paying more attention to #2 and #3. Between the two, #2 was more appealing._ 

*2. For the visualization that you find most appealing please answer the following:*

- Can you tell me what you think this is?
_This is a line depicting federal debt as a percentage of US GDP._

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
_This line is telling me that federal debt as a percentage of US GDP has reached a level in 2020 that is unprecedented._ 

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
_At first, I was confused as to why something could be over 100%, because we usually think about statistics or similar graphs being only up to 100%. It took me awhile to figure out that this was as a percentage of US GDP, so debt could go above current GDP. I was confused by the phrase" excluding intra-gov holdings" as I do not know what that means and there is no explanation for it._ 

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
_People who are interested in small government, or the average reader who likes to be informed._

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
_I thought the line was interesting because the last time debt was so high was during / after WWII. I took me awhile to make that connection, so maybe the graph could highlight that through a subtitle or marking (if that is indeed the point being made). Otherwise, I like the simplicity of the graph._
