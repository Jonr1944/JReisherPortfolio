### **Greatest National Debt to GDP Ratios in 2020**


<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6szl" width="860" height="645" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true"><a href="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6szl" target="_blank">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2020</a></iframe>

To start my visualization, I wanted to present a simple, clear bar graph that helps set the stage for the viewer. The message is hopefully clear in terms of which country has the greatest debt to GDP
ratio as a percent. By ordering the countries smallest percent on left and greatest on the right the viewer can easily determine who has the greatest debt and who is close behind. In the case the top 
country is Greece followed by the US and Portugal. Additionally, the blue color palette is simple and does not distract from the information presented. I am not trying to highlight any specific country 
here so having each bar be the same color is ideal.


### **Debt to GDP Ratios by Country**

For the second visualization, the chart becomes way more complicated because there is one line graph for each country. However, because the viewer already has an introduction to the material in the first,
simple graph my hope is that it is more relatable. This would not be a good chart to start with because it could easily overwhelm a viewer who is still trying to understand what the story is depicting. Though
there is a lot of smaller graphs, the repetitiveness of the format makes it more consumable in that it allows the viewer to focus on the differences between countries rather than trying to relearn each graph. 
Put another way, the chart establishes a convention and sticks with it. Finally, this visualization depicts changes over time. This makes the dot at the end of the chart important because it draws the viewer 
to the current or last measured data point. The line places the last known data point in context by telling each country's debt history. I also tried to make use of the subtitle to be very clear about what the
red line is depicting so that the reader does not have to guess or extrapolate. This also keeps the graphic cleaner by not having axis labels for every graph.


### **Violin plot of Variance of the Debt to GDP Ratio by Country**

In the final visualization, I decided to use a violin plot which depicts the variance and frequency of each country’s debt for all the years in which there is data. This gives the reader another way to understand
each country’s debt to GDP ratio history. Each data point is shaded red for each year. I wanted to use shading instead of a solid color so that the viewer could see which dots overlap. I also wanted the viewer to
easily discern each individual point. The linework on each dot is a solid black line meant to highlight each individual dot. So, my use of color is deliberate in the sense I wanted the viewer to understand where a 
country had many data points and be able to make out individual points.

The violin plot is the shaded orange color behind the data points. The intent of the violin plot is to help the viewer quickly make out where there was high frequency in the data. The thicker the 'violin' shape the 
higher the frequency. Some countries have almost a straight line, indicating more variance than countries with a violin shape like Chilies. Countries like Chilies indicate that their debt to GDP ratios is more stable
in that there is not a ton of fluctuation. I tried to use the subtitle and the footer to help the viewer easily understand the information. Particularly if they are not familiar with violin plots.
