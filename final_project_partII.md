## Work Flow Summary

*Issues:* Overall, I spent far too much time building my Twitter API and trying to get my Tableau charts to render on the webpage. I am not very good at coding in HTML or Java so Shorthand does not render Tableau Online charts. I will probably be forced to rebuild my charts on Florish or make them into PDFs.

*Opportunties:* My user research results really helped me dial in where I can be more persuasive and how to rearrange my charts to build a more persusaive story. Its relativily easy to build an individual chart. But its far more difficult to create something that lands with the audience. 

#### Key Findings

Through my research I found that 1.8 million Hungarians chose to get the Spudnik V vaccine out of a possible 2 million. This is significant because that indicates that out of Hungary's 9.7 million people around 18.5% views Russia as the most legitate or trustworthy in terms of vaccine production. 

Another key finding is that the majority of the COVD19 related hashtags are either nutural (could be used for information or disinformation) or negative (are used for disinformation). There are no onjectively positive hashtags trending in Hungary last week. In fact, one of the hashtags is the name of a Far Right Opposition leader.

Finally, there is a disparity in second dose vaccination for those who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Over 500,000 people failed to get their second does, far greater than another group that recieved a Russian, Chinese, or British vaccines. 

#### Insights

Twitter data is difficult to work with for a vizulization project. However, it is impossible to work with Facebook data at the present. This is because Facebook privacy laws do not allow researchers or third parties to analize content. This is unfortunate because an estimated 95% of Hungarians have Facebook and only 2% have a Twitter page. Twitter, however, is a good indication of what Hungarian parities or organizations are trying to signal to people, organizations, and countries outside of Hungary with higher Twitter presences. 

## Storyboard

[Short Hand Diagram](https://shorthand.com/organisations/JSrgFWI7zn/stories/acQGpXcsWp)

Below are the slides that I sent my user research participants. I would have preferred to send them a draft of the short hand website, given my Tableau rendering issues I had to improvise with a PDF. This was a tad problematic, in that I did not have the coorisponding text to go along with the charts. However, the user research yeilded some very good feedback on how I can make the story more compelling.

## User Research

Question &	Response
1. *What is the purpose of the visualizations?*	 The purpose of the visualisations are to draw attention to how Victor Orban has used the pandemic to solidify power and/or spread misinformation about COVID vaccines. [honestly, I found it a little hard to follow the storyboard without much background information on Hungary.]
2. *What is missing in the story?* 	 I think what is missing is the overall context of why this story is important, and also the level of COVID disinformation in Hungary. The graphics on hashtags seemed interesting but I struggled to understand them. 
3. What works well?	 There was variation in the graphics which made the storyboard interesting (tables, bar graphs). Disinformation is also a “hot” topic that would normally spark interest. 
4. Are their confusing graphs or graphics? If so which ones and which part of the visualization is confusing?	 Graph 1 – The y-axis label is hard to read. The x-axis is also hard to read in the “Year Week” format. It’s hard to know what is the 16th week in 2020, maybe months might be easier, even though I know the weekly visualization is also more accurate. 
Graph 2 – I’m not entirely clear how the 3 tweets show how Victor Orban has used the COVID pandemic to solidify his rule. Not sure if perhaps more exposition is needed?
Graph 3 – I don’t really know what the main point is. I know it shows me the different type of vaccines given out in each week, but not certain what trend I’m looking for. I also don’t know what “Year Week ISO” means, 
Graph 4 – similar to 3, I know what this chart is saying but not sure what the main point is. Maybe it’s useful to put the main point in the subtitle, unless the audience is meant to interpret this on their own? Having gone to the end of the storyboard, I now realise that the disinformation led to a drop in second doses for Pfizer. Maybe changing the sequence would have made this chart clearer?
Graph 5 – I’m not sure what “Hu and Serbian” means or are? Without context, it’s hard to figure this graph out. I suppose that my attention is meant to be drawn to “Hu” which is a different color. 
Chart 1  - I realise now that Hu and Serbian mean Hungarian and Serbian. I’m still abit confused as to whether these are Hungarian and Serbian twitter accounts, if so, I don’t know why the Hungarian hashtags are a higher number than Hungarian & Serbian hashtags – I assume the former is a subset of the latter?
Info Graphic 3 – the text in each box is difficult to read because it’s small. I do like the call to action statement “Think before you click”. It’s catchy. 


## Mood Board

I wanted to create a way to find the best color pallet for my story. I searched on Google Images for disinformation related infographics and found that there were really three main colors pallets that was used:  blue / white, purple, and black/red color pallet. I am going to use the blue / white color pallet because it resignated the most during my user research and it also mirrors the colors used by Twitter.

## Personas 

I created two user personas. One of a middle aged man with not a lot of formal education but confident in his abilities and place in life. Too often people are over confident in their ability to discern what is fake and what is not. I want to appeal to those kinds of people by demonstrating that there are people who desire to mislead on social media. The second persona is more the young, white collar worker who is immersed in technology and may not fully understand the effects it is having on society. A secondary goal of the project is to raise awarness that the media we share has the ability to create real issues for people.
