#### _About Me_

My name is Jon Reisher and I am a second year Master's of Public Policy student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am very interested in international development and how data can help create common understanding of problems. 

I was born in Germany but grew up in Western Washington State. I enjoy doing anything outdoors including hiking, fishing, and skiing. I also enjoy sports such as baseball, American football, and rugby. I really enjoy traveling and my favorite place I have been to so far is Jordan.

#### _What I hope to Learn_

I hope to learn how to create data visulizations that will tell an effective story, accurately depict a problem, and help convince people to create positive change. 

After I graduate, I hope to eventually work for an organization that does community oriented development overseas. International development is vital for the creating peaceful, stable nations and just societies. Too often nations intervene to "nation build" or dictate development projects in developing countries. This is not sustainable over the long term because this kind of development fails to take into account the actual needs of a community. I hope to help change this culture.
